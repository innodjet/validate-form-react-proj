## What is phone?
`phone` is used to normalize mobile phone numbers into E.164 format.

A common problem is that users normally input phone numbers in this way:

```
`(817) 569-8900` or
`817569-8900` or
`1(817) 569-8900` or
`+1(817) 569-8900` or ...
```

We always want:

```
+18175698900
```

## Install
```
npm install phone
```


## Usage
```javascript
const phone  = require('phone');

phone('+852 6569-8900'); // return ['+85265698900', 'HKG']
phone('(817) 569-8900'); // return ['+18175698900, 'USA']
phone('(817) 569-8900', ''); // return ['+18175698900, 'USA']
phone('(817) 569-8900', 'USA'); // return ['+18175698900', 'USA']
phone('(817) 569-8900', 'HKG'); // return []
phone('+1(817) 569-8900', 'HKG'); // return [], as it is not a valid HKG mobile phone number
phone('+1(817) 569-8900', ''); // return ['+18175698900', 'USA']
phone('(817) 569-8900', ''); // return ['+18175698900', 'USA']
phone('6123-6123', ''); // return [], as default country is USA
phone('6123-6123', 'HKG'); // return ['+85261236123', 'HKG']
```

## Test

```
npm test
```

## Build

## Old browsers & browser support

We currently transpile script to work on target environments for which the browser's global usage is >1%, and Node.js 6.10+.

You can check browser usage statistics on the [browserlist](http://browserl.ist/?q=%3E1%25).

You may need polyfills for some older browsers; for more details, please read the `example/README` file.


## FAQ

1. Does `phone` do any logical validation?

	Yes. If you provide the 2nd parameter (country), and the phone number does not start with `+` sign.

	`phone` will validate `phone_number_lengths` and `mobile_begin_with`

2. Why is `phone` returning null for a valid phone number?

	This package is used to validate a mobile phone number for sending the SMS.

	Therefore, we try to match all possible rules for specifically checking whether a number is mobile, such as area code, number prefix, etc.

	However, some countries, like the USA, don't have mobile identifiers, so we can only check if the input has a valid area code.

	For example, we know that UK mobile phone numbers always start with `7`. In this case, `phone` can verify that the number is actually mobile.


## Help

We've tried to make sure that this package works for as many cases as possible, if you notice that we have an incorrect rule for a country or other case, please open an issue to let us know.
